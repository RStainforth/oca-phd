About
==========

This directory contains OCADB files created by the Laserball Asymmetry Analysis tool. These files have, for each data set and wavelength, the sinusoidal angular distribution parameters obtained from this analysis.
They are used as an input to OCA by choosing the appropriate settings in the fitfiles.
