About
==========
This directory contains the OCARun files for the October 2003 laserball scans from SNO. OCARun files can be found here once the original SNO RDT files in ${OCA_SNOPLUS_DATA/runs/rdt/oct03 have been converted to SOC files, and then once those SOC files have been converted to OCARun files.

See the scripts in the following directories for further information:

    1) ${OCA_SNOPLUS_ROOT}/scripts/rdt2soc - RDT to SOC conversion
    2) ${OCA_SNOPLUS_ROOT}/scripts/soc2oca - SOC to OCARun conversion
